# README #

Quizzer is a simple application written in python.

The demo quiz bundled (drivers_licence.quiz) is for the New Zealand drivers licence, and will be updated as I learn more ;)

## Installing ##

Installing is as easy as pulling down the source!

### Dependencies ###

The Tk interface relies on the python tkinter package, and the tk libraries.

## Contribution guidelines ##

- Stick to the existing style
- Write clean code...
- File a bug/enhancement request first, then write the code if I think it is a good idea :) Or you could just fork this...

### Quiz file format ###

I will probably not bundle any more quizzes with this program. However, feel free to write your own quiz; the file format it pretty simple.
