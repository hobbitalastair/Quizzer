# README #

Quizzer is a simple application written in python.

The demo quiz bundled (drivers_licence.quiz) is for the New Zealand drivers licence, and will be updated as I learn more ;)

## Installing ##

Installing is as easy as pulling down the source!

### Dependencies ###

The Tk interface relies on the python tkinter package, and the tk libraries.

## Contribution guidelines ##

Following in the existing style is mandatory; where the style is not obvious raise an issue.
I will welcome any good changes with open arms.

Good changes are changes that improve what already exists by making it faster, simpler, and more reliable.

### Quiz file format ###

I will probably not bundle any more quizzes with this program. However, feel free to write your own quiz; the file format it pretty simple.

Prompt questions with 1 written answer are in the format Question: Answer
Multichoice questions are in the format Question: Answer ID, with following options indented 4 spaces in the format ID: Answer text

## Contacts ##

Me! Raise an issue - I'll hopefully spot it.
